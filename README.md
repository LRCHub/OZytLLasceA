```
One look give ‘em Whiplash
Beat drop with a big flash
집중해 좀 더 Think fast
이유 넌 이해 못 해
왜 이제야 Know I did that
Day 1 know I been bad
Don’t stop 흔들린 채
무리해도 Can’t touch that
(Can’t touch that)
Under pressure, body sweating
Can you focus
어디서나 거침없어
I’m the coldest
오직 나만이 이 판을 바꿀 Changer
Just close your eyes,
breathe in and visualize
One look give ‘em Whiplash
Beat drop with a big flash
집중해 좀 더 Think fast
이유 넌 이해 못 해
왜 이제야 Know I did that
Day 1 know I been bad
Don’t stop 흔들린 채
무리해도 Can’t touch that
(Can’t touch that)
Whip-Whiplash Whip-Whiplash
Whip-Whiplash Whip-Whiplash
Whip-Whiplash Whip-Whiplash
Whip-Whiplash
One look give ‘em Whiplash
Fancy
이건 참 화려해
It’s glowing and it’s flashy
알아 적당함이 뭔지
Keep it classy
따라 하지 넌 또 하나부터 열까지
아닌척하지
Yeah
Under pressure, body sweating
Can you focus (Hoo)
I deliver, I can promise
I’m the coldest (Cold)
외면해도 소용없지
Don’t you blow it
Just close your eyes,
breathe in and visualize
시작되는 순간 끝나버린 판단
기횐 오직 One time Unforgettable
찾아낸 The right light
사라지지 않아 눈에 새긴
One time Unforgettable
One look give ‘em Whiplash
Beat drop with a big flash
집중해 좀 더 Think fast
이유 넌 이해 못 해
왜 이제야 Know I did that
Day 1 know I been bad
Don’t stop 흔들린 채
무리해도 Can’t touch that
(Can’t touch that)
I’m the highlight
비춰 Red light
Yeah Tonight, it’s all about me
(All about me)
You know it’s my site
거친 Next sigh 만들어갈 History
One look give ‘em Whiplash
(Whip-Whip)
Beat drop with a big flash
따라와 어서 Move fast
(Move move move)
이유 넌 이해 못 해
왜 이제야 Know I did that
(Did that)
Day 1 know I been bad (Been bad)
Don’t stop 흔들린 채
다가와도 Can’t touch that
(Can’t touch that)
Whip-Whiplash Whip-Whiplash
Whip-Whiplash Whip-Whiplash
Whip-Whiplash Whip-Whiplash
Whip-Whiplash
